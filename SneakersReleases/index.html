    <div class="description">If you want to know which are the upcoming sneakers then you're at the right place. In this website we will post a lot of sneaker releases and also some reviews. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</div>

    <div class="snkrs-details"> Dubbed initially “Chicago Reimagined,” the upcoming Air Jordan 1 in the classic Bulls colorway has gotten a new name and theme in “Lost and Found.” The Air Jordan 1 High “Lost and Found” is a love letter to the days of the mom-and-pop shop and happening upon a shoe in the wild. The shoe takes on a vintage appearance with its worn look; cracked leather accents appear on the white base and black accents, while the red leather overlays come in pristine condition. An aged white midsole and red outsole with a chalky white look to mimic the dustiness of stored sneakers complete the decades-old feel. <br><br>- Retail price: 180$<br>- Assumed resell price: 400-600$</div>
